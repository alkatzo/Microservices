Example: Complex Microservices with Service Mesh in AWS EKS (Using Istio)
This example shows how to deploy a multi-microservice architecture in AWS EKS with Istio service mesh. It includes:

✅ Microservices Communication: Services interact securely with traffic routing.<br />
✅ Traffic Shaping: Route traffic based on headers, load, or versions (A/B testing).<br />
✅ Observability: Distributed tracing, monitoring, and logging with Prometheus & Jaeger.<br />
✅ mTLS Encryption: Secure communication between services.<br />

1️⃣ Architecture Overview<br />
Services:<br />
frontend-service (User Interface, public)<br />
<br />
orders-service (Processes orders, internal)<br />
<br />
payments-service (Handles payments, internal)<br />
<br />
inventory-service (Manages stock, internal)<br />

Traffic Flow:<br />
Users access frontend-service via an AWS ALB (Application Load Balancer).<br />
<br />
Istio Gateway manages ingress traffic to frontend-service.<br />
<br />
frontend-service calls orders-service.<br />
<br />
orders-service calls payments-service and inventory-service.<br />
<br />
Istio automatically manages retries, observability, and security.<br />
