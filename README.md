Example: Complex Microservices with Service Mesh in AWS EKS (Using Istio)
This example shows how to deploy a multi-microservice architecture in AWS EKS with Istio service mesh. It includes:

✅ Microservices Communication: Services interact securely with traffic routing.<br />
✅ Traffic Shaping: Route traffic based on headers, load, or versions (A/B testing).<br />
✅ Observability: Distributed tracing, monitoring, and logging with Prometheus & Jaeger.<br />
✅ mTLS Encryption: Secure communication between services.<br />

1️⃣ Architecture Overview
Services:
frontend-service (User Interface, public)

orders-service (Processes orders, internal)

payments-service (Handles payments, internal)

inventory-service (Manages stock, internal)

Traffic Flow:
Users access frontend-service via an AWS ALB (Application Load Balancer).

Istio Gateway manages ingress traffic to frontend-service.

frontend-service calls orders-service.

orders-service calls payments-service and inventory-service.

Istio automatically manages retries, observability, and security.
